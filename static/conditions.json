It is identical to that document, save that this version includes an SEQ legal credit.  In addition to the provisions that would typically be included in any set of website terms and conditions, this document includes provisions covering user accounts and user-generated content (although the latter are not as detailed as in some of our more sophisticated website terms and conditions documents).  If your website does not feature user accounts or interactive features, you may wish to consider our website disclaimer document instead of these terms and conditions.\nSection 1: Introduction\nSection 1.2\nOptional element.\nThe completed document should be easily accessible on the website, with a link from every page.\nSection 1.3\nOptional element. Will all or any website users give their express consent to the terms of this document?\nIdeally, from a legal perspective, all users would be asked to expressly agree to the terms of the document. However, in practice, express consent is rarely sought from casual website visitors. On the other hand, it is easy to obtain the express consent of users who register with the website or submit any material to the website, e.g. by clicking \"I accept\" on an electronic version of the document. You should retain evidence of the acceptance of the document terms by each such user.\nUnder what circumstances will users be asked to give their express consent to the terms of this document?\nSection 1.4\nOptional element. Are there any age restrictions on the use of the website?\nThe use of websites by minors can be legally problematic. There are a number of different legal issues. For example, under English law, contracts may be unenforceable against minors. Another issue concerns data protection. The law of data protection imposes additional burdens in relation to the processing of any personal data of a minor and personal data provided by a minor. The effects of the law of indecency may also depend upon whether a website is accessible by minors. Obviously, the inclusion of a requirement in your terms and conditions that minors refrain from using a website is no guarantee that they will do so. Where your website is directed at, or likely to be used by, minors, we recommend that you seek specialist legal advice.\nWhat is the minimum age for website users?\nSection 1.5\nOptional element. Does the website use cookies (including session cookies and third party cookies)?\nThe inclusion of this statement in your website legal documents will not in itself satisfy the requirements of the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 (as amended) concerning consent to the use of cookies. Guidance concerning methods of obtaining such consent is included on the Information Commissioner's website (http://www.ico.gov.uk).\nWhat is the title of the document on the website that contains cookie information?\nSection 2: Credit\nSection: Free documents licensing warning\nOptional element. Although you need to retain the credit, you should remove the inline copyright warning from this document before use.\nSection 3: Copyright notice\nSection 3.1\nWhat was the year of first publication of the relevant copyright material (or the range of years)?\nWho is the principal owner of copyright in the website?\nSection 4: Licence to use website\nThe scope of the licence to use will vary with each site. Consider carefully exactly what your users should be allowed to do with your website and material on your website.\nSection 4.1\nWill audio and/or video files be published on the website?\nWill the website make available any dynamic services to users?\nDescribe the website services in question.\nSection 4.2\nOptional element.\nSection 4.3\nOptional element.\nFor what purposes may the website be used?\nSection 4.4\nOptional element.\nSection 4.6\nOptional element.

Should the website operator be granted a right to bring proceedings in respect of third party infringements?\nSection 9.5\nOptional element.

Can users edit their own content after it has been posted to the website?\nSection 10: Your content: rules\nSection 10.2\nThis very general prohibition against unlawful user content may be supplemented by rules relating to specific kinds of illegality, as well as prohibitions upon lawful but undesirable content.\nSection 10.3\nOptional element.\nDo you want to expressly prohibit the publication by users of information about how to commit crimes and the promotion of criminal activities?\nShould the depiction of violence be prohibited?\nShould the prohibition on depicting violence be limited to explicit etc violence?\nShould pornographic material be prohibited?\nShould the prohibition on pornographic material be supplemented with a prohibition on lewd, suggestive or sexually explicit material?\nShould untrue, false, inaccurate or misleading content be prohibited?\nShould potentially dangerous advice be prohibited?\nShould spam be prohibited?\nShould offensive etc material be prohibited?\nShould annoying etc material be prohibited?\nSection 11: Limited warranties\nSection 11.1\nOptional element.\nSection 11.2\nOptional element.\nSection 12: Limitations and exclusions of liability\nContractual limitations and exclusions of liability are regulated and controlled by law, and the courts may rule that particular limitations and exclusions of liability in contracts are unenforceable. The courts are particularly likely to intervene where a party is seeking to rely on a limitation or exclusion of liability in its standard terms and conditions, but will also sometimes intervene where a term has been individually negotiated. The courts may be more likely to rule that provisions excluding liability, as opposed to those merely limiting liability, are unenforceable. If there is a risk that any particular limitation or exclusion of liability will be found to be unenforceable by the courts, that provision should be drafted as an independent term, and be numbered separately from the other provisions. It may improve the chances of a limitation or exclusion of liability being found to be enforceable if the party seeking to rely upon it specifically drew it to the attention of the other party before the contract was entered into. Exclusions and limitations of liability in UK contracts are primarily regulated by the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 (\"UCTA\"). Contracts regulated by UCTA cannot exclude or restrict a party's liability for death or personal injury resulting from negligence (Section 2(1), UCTA). Except insofar as the relevant term satisfies the requirements of reasonableness, such contracts cannot exclude or restrict liability: (i) for negligence (which includes a breach of an express or implied contractual obligation to take reasonable care or exercise reasonable skill) (Section 2(2), UCTA); or (ii) for misrepresentation (Section 3, Misrepresentation Act 1967). In addition, if a contract is regulated by UCTA, and one of the parties is dealing on the other's written standard terms of business, then except insofar as the relevant contractual term satisfies the requirements of reasonableness the other party cannot: (i) exclude or restrict his liability in respect of a breach of contract; or (ii) claim to be entitled to render a contractual performance substantially different from that which was reasonably expected of him; or (iii) claim to be entitled, in respect of the whole or any part of his contractual obligation, to render no contractual performance at all (see Section 3, UCTA). UCTA includes various other restrictions, particularly in the case of contracts for the sale of goods and contracts under which possession or ownership of goods passes. If you wish to try to limit/exclude for liability in respect of reckless, deliberate, personal and/or repudiatory breaches of contract, you should specify this in relation to the relevant provision (for example, using the following wording: \"The limitations and exclusions of liability in this Clause [number] will apply whether or not the liability in question arises out of any reckless, deliberate, personal and/or repudiatory conduct or breach of contract\"). In many circumstances, however, the courts will find these types of limitations and exclusions to be unenforceable. Somewhat different rules apply to limitations of liability in contracts with consumers, and these provisions should not be used in relation to such contracts. These guidance notes provide a very incomplete and basic overview of a complex subject. Accordingly, you should take legal advice if you may wish to rely upon a limitation or exclusion of liability.\nSection 12.1\nDo not delete this provision (except upon legal advice). Without this provision, the specific limitations and exclusions of liability in the document are more likely to be unenforceable.\nSection 12.3\nOptional element. Do you want to attempt to exclude all liability for free services and information?\nThis sort of exclusion is quite common, but unlikely to be enforceable in court.\nSection 12.5\nOptional element.\nSection 12.6\nOptional element.\nSection 12.7\nOptional element.\n\"Consequential loss\" has a special meaning in English law: it means any loss that, whilst not arising naturally from the breach, was specifically in the contemplation of the parties when the contract was made.\nSection 12.8\nOptional element. If the website operator is a limited liability entity (e.g. a limited company), do you want to expressly exclude liability on the part of officers and employees?\nSection 13: Breaches of these terms and conditions\nSection 13.1\nWill account suspension or deletion be a possibility here?\nSection 13.2\nOptional element.\nDo you wish to specify types of action that are prohibited here?\nDetail the types of action which are prohibited by this provision.\nSection 14: Variation\nChanges to legal documents published on a website will not generally be retrospectively effective, and variations without notice to and/or consent from relevant users may be ineffective.\nSection 14.2\nWill website users be notified of changes to the document?\nSection 14.3\nOptional element. Will registered users be required to consent to variations?\nSection 17: Third party rights\nOptional element.\nThis provision is designed to exclude any rights a third party may have under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.\nSection 18: Entire agreement\nSection 18.1\nWhat other documents govern the use of the website?\nSection 19: Law and jurisdiction\nThe questions of which law governs a document and where disputes relating to the document may be litigated are two distinct questions.\nSection 19.1\nThis document has been drafted to comply with English law, and the governing law provision should not be changed without obtaining expert advice from a lawyer qualified in the appropriate jurisdiction. In some circumstances the courts will apply provisions of their local law, such as local competition law or consumer protection law, irrespective of a choice of law clause.\nWhich law should govern the document?\nSection 19.2\nIn some circumstances your jurisdiction clause may be overridden by the courts.\nShould the jurisdiction granted be exclusive or non-exclusive? Choose \"non-exclusive\" jurisdiction if you may want to enforce the terms and conditions against users outside England and Wales. Otherwise, choose \"exclusive jurisdiction\".\nThe courts of which country or jurisdiction should adjudicate disputes under the document?\nSection 20: Statutory and regulatory disclosures\nDo the Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002 apply to the website or is the website operator registered for VAT?\nThis section can be deleted where website operator is not registered for VAT and the Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002 do not apply. Generally, those Regulations will apply unless a website is entirely non-commercial, i.e. where a website does not offer any goods or services and does not involve any remuneration (which includes remuneration for carrying AdSense or other advertising).\nSection 20.1\nOptional element. Is the website operator registered in a trade or similar register that is available to the public?\nThe Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002 provide that if you are \"registered in a trade or similar register available to the public\", you must provide \"details of the register in which the service provider is entered and his registration number, or equivalent means of identification in that register\".\nWhat is the name of the trade register?\nAt what URL can the trade register be found?\nWhat is the website operator's registration number?\nSection 20.2\nOptional element. Is the website operator subject to an authorisation scheme (e.g. under financial services legislation)?\nThe Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002 provide that \"where the provision of the service is subject to an authorisation scheme\" you must provide \"the particulars of the relevant supervisory authority\".\nWhat is the name of the authorisation scheme to which the website operator is subject?\nWhat authority supervises the authorisation scheme?\nSection 20.3\nOptional element. Is the service provider a member of a regulated profession (e.g. solicitors)?\nThe Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002 provide that if \"the service provider exercises a regulated profession\", it must provide \"(i) the details of any professional body or similar institution with which the service provider is registered; (ii) his professional title and the member State where that title has been granted; (iii) a reference to the professional rules applicable to the service provider in the member State of establishment and the means to access them\".\nWhat is the website operator's professional title?\nWhich professional body regulates the website operator?\nIn which jurisdiction was the professional title granted?\nWhat is the name of the document containing the rules governing the profession?\nAt what URL can the rules be found?\nSection 20.4\nOptional element. Does the website operator subscribe to any codes of conduct?\nThe Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002 provide that \"a service provider shall indicate which relevant codes of conduct he subscribes to and give information on how those codes can be consulted electronically\".\nIdentify the codes of conduct in question.\nWhere can the codes be viewed?\nSection 20.5\nOptional element. Is the website operator registered for VAT?\nWhat is the website operator's VAT number?\nSection 21: Our details\nOptional element.\nUK companies must provide their corporate names, their registration numbers, their place of registration and their registered office address on their websites (although not necessarily in this document). Sole traders and partnerships that carry on a business in the UK under a \"business name\" (i.e. a name which is not the name of the trader/names of the partners or certain other specified classes of name) must also make certain website disclosures: (i) in the case of a sole trader, the individual's name; (ii) in the case of a partnership, the name of each member of the partnership; and (iii) in either case, in relation to each person named, an address in the UK at which service of any document relating in any way to the business will be effective. All websites covered by the Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002 must provide a geographic address (not a PO Box number) and an email address. All website operators covered by the Provision of Services Regulations 2009 must also provide a telephone number.\nSection 21.1\nWhat is the name of the company, partnership, individual or other legal person or entity that owns and operates the website?\nSection 21.2\nOptional element. Is the relevant person a company?\nIn what jurisdiction is the company registered?\nWhat is the company's registration number or equivalent?\nWhere is the company's registered address?\nSection 21.3\nOptional element.\nWhere is the relevant person's head office or principal place of business?"
